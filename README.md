# Byond Topics
This repository offers code and documentation on the BYOND Topic protocol.

## Why?
The BYOND Topic protocol is ill-documented around the net, and accurate resources for querying it from an external program are few and far between. The intent of this repo is to provide current, accurate documentation on the protocol, and offer simple solutions to implement it in various programming languages.
