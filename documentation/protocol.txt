# Topic protocol documentation.

This file contains information about BYOND Topic protocol, as reversed by BobOfDoom. This information reflects a post on the BYOND forum by Crispy from 2005, which may be found here: https://secure.byond.com/forum/?post=276414#comment1156465

Please note that there are differences in the modern protocol, and the protocol referenced in the post. These differences will be pointed out as they are referencd.

## Sending a Topic request.

The protocol to send a topic request to a BYOND server is as follows:

1 byte - 0x00
1 byte - 0x83
1 byte - Length of data. This differs from the original post linked above, and is correct. If you attempt to use 2 bytes for this, you will receive an "Invalid topic request" response. Length of data should be length(yourmessage)+6. The first 5 padding bytes, and final NULL byte are counted in this value. Therefore it must have +6 added on to it.
5 bytes - All 0x00
X bytes - Your data in ASCII, pre-pended by a question mark (?).
1 byte - 0x00 // Signals end of packet.

Therefore, a standard ?ping request should look like so(values with \x## are in hexadecimal):
[\x00 \x83 \x00 \x0B \x00 \x00 \x00 \x00 \x00 ? p i n g \x00]

In this instance, \x0B is the length of the data sent (?ping+6). The data and length are the only parts that need to be provided on-the-fly. All other data is static.

## Receiving a Topic Response

The topic response data is similar to the request. However, the length variable is a UInt16 rather than a Byte like the send protocol.

Topic response format is as follows:

1 byte - 0x00
1 byte - 0x83
UInt16/short (2 bytes) - UInt16 describing length of following data. The end of the full packet will happen at this value +4 if read all at once.
1 byte - Data type of following data. 0x00 is NULL/unsupported, 0x2A is a float32, and 0x06 is a String.
X bytes - Data being received, variable length depending on what is being sent.

Therefore, a ?ping response might look like this:
[\x00 \x83 \x00 \x05 \x2A \x00 \x00 \x29 \x43]

In this instance, \x00\x05 is the UInt16 describing the length of the rest of the packet, including the type data. \x2A is indicating the remaining data will be a Float32. The \x29\x43 is the returned value from the ping operation, which by standard on Space Station 13 indicates the number of players online at the time of the request. In this case, it is 169.

In a standard array, bytes 0 and 1 can be ignored, bytes 2 and 3 indicate message length, byte 4 is the type, and all remaining bytes are the data.
